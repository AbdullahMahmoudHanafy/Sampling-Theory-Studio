# Sampling-Theory-Studio
A desktop application illustrating signal sampling and recovery based on the Nyquistâ€“Shannon theorem. Users can load and compose signals, sample at various frequencies, visualize original, sampled, and reconstructed signals in real-time, and explore different reconstruction methods while adding noise and investigating aliasing effects.
